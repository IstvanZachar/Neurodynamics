Instructions to generate data and image for Figure 4.

1. Compile `meta7.c` with custom libraries included: `randomGenerator.c` and `colors.c`.
2. Run `meta7.c` to generate data to the standard output. 
3. Generated data should be saved in a `.dat` file, e.g. `envchange.dat`. Pre-generated data is provided as `envchange.dat`.
4. Data file `envchange.dat` is read by the *Mathematica& code `plotter.nb` to generate image (optimized for *Mathematica* 11.0.0.0).
   Pre-generated image is provided as `envchange.tiff`.
